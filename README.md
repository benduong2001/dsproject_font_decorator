# DSC190 Project - Eigen-Fonts

* This DSC190 project will explore the UC Irvine Character Font Image Dataset
* Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Character+Font+Images
* Comparisons between different fonts will be made, and unsupervised labelling techniques to group together fonts into "groups" (e.g. serif, sans-serif, cursive, etc) based on their distinct characteristics, via
  * K-means clustering, 
  * Principal Component Analysis and other linear algebra topics such as cosine similarity,
  * Spectral embedding, with a visit of Laplacian Eigenmaps,
* Eventual Goal (Extra Credit): Convolutional Neural Network to classify unlabeled images of letters on font group 
* Files:
  * dsproject_font_decorator.ipynb - rough draft EDA Jupyter Notebook
  * eigenfonts.ipynb - final draft
