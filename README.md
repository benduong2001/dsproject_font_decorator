# Computer Vision with Font Types

* This data science project on computer vision will cover font type categorization
* Unsupervised Learning techniques: Eventually settled for Spectral Embedding and K-means Clustering, after Laplacian EigenMaps and PCA
* Convolutional Neural Networks with variable input size
* CV2 Image processing and character segmentation
* A final demonstration of to eventually classify the font-types of input photoscanned text.
* The kaggle notebook will cover more details.
